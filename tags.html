        <h3>1.Quotation</h3>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.sethcasteel.com/#!/about_Seth">
            I was photographing a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Buster back in 2010 in his backyard in California. The photo shoot was meant to be "On-land", but Buster decided he would rather be in the pool. As I watched him dive in over and over again chasing his favorite mini tennis ball, I thought, "What does he look like under there!!". I left, bought a little point-and-shoot underwater camera, zipped back and jumped in. The resulting photos were the beginning of the series of Underwater Dogs.
